Client Side Form Validation

Validation attributes on forms:

required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.

minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).

min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.

type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.

pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.


Note: There are several errors that will prevent the form from being submitted, including a badInput, 
patternMismatch, rangeOverflow or rangeUnderflow, stepMismatch, tooLong or tooShort, typeMismatch, 
valueMissing, or a customError.

Regexps - regular expression pattern

a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).
abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.
ab?c — Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. (ac or abc)
ab*c — Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by c. (ac, abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.
abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or y, and so on).

Note: The <textarea> element doesn't support the pattern attribute.
